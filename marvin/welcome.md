Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to welcome you to the community.

So hi, @user! :wave:

I'm Marvin. I'm here to make sure the community is always a positive and supportive place. This is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy, is it?

The best way to get started is by saying hello in the #introductions channel. Before posting, please review our <https://docs.prefect.io/core/community.html|community rules>:

• Be respectful; we assume positive intent from you and we ask the same in return
• Use threads when possible to keep conversations contained
• Avoid posting large walls of text or code blocks (you can use threads for this, too!)
• Avoid posting sensitive information
• Don't abuse tagging other users
• Avoid using DMs to ask for help
• Don't advertise material unrelated to Prefect

It’s possible your question has been asked before, so please take a moment to review the Slack history and our other searchable resources:

• <https://docs.prefect.io|Prefect's documentation>
• <https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect|The Prefect GitHub repositories>
• <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prefect|StackOverflow>

When possible, I will automatically <https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Prefect+Slack+Community%22|archive helpful Slack threads> to GitHub to help other users.

Make sure to join [Prefect Discourse](https://discourse.prefect.io/) - a knowledge base with plenty of tutorials, answers to frequently asked questions, code examples, blog posts, announcements, troubleshooting tips, and in-depth technical discussions.

You may also want to follow us on <https://twitter.com/prefectio|Twitter> or <https://www.linkedin.com/company/prefect/|LinkedIn>.

Happy Engineering!
